If your energy use is higher than these estimates, you may consider installing a bigger sized solar system. However, if you use less energy than our estimates there is no economic advantage in installing a solar system less than 4kW in size.</p>`,

    sectionBody: `<p>The geographical location of your house determines how much solar energy you can generate. For example, if you live in Cairns, your solar system will generate more energy each year than if you live in Tasmania. Our savings calculations and pay back times take this into account and assume you use 25% of the solar energy you generate.</p>
<p>The more people who live in your house, the more energy you will use so there are more benefits in investing in a bigger sized solar system. Geographical location and solar system size are the main factors that determine the amount of savings and length of payback times.</p>`,
