<p *ngIf="modalContentId === 're2'">The kW size of a solar photovoltaic system is the maximum amount of electricity it can deliver. A system of this size should meet the typical energy needs of a household of your size. This estimate assumes you have enough roof space to install a system of this size.</p>

  <p>This calculation estimates the period of time it will take you to completely pay off your solar system based on the energy savings you make in your home and the income you earn from feeding excess energy back to the grid.</p>
  <p>Our calculation assumes that you have a north-facing rooftop with no tree shading and that you consume 25% of the solar energy you generate.</p>
